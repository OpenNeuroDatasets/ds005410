  "TaskDescription": "The experiment consisted of two phases: acquisition and test. Each trial involved a sequence of three events: a word, followed by a tactile stimulus, and then an auditory stimulus. During acquisition, words from one category (e.g., animals) were followed by a left-hand vibration and a pleasant sound (US-), while words from another category (e.g., clothing) were followed by a right-hand vibration and the same pleasant sound. In the acquisition phase, there were 15 trials of each type. In the test phase, 110 trials replicated the acquisition sequences, and 110 trials presented incorrect word-tactile pairings followed by a loud noise (US+), designating the CS+ condition. Sequences with correct pairings were referred to as the CS- condition. During the acquisition phase only CS- sequences were delivered to decrease the complexity of the paradigm and facilitate learning while keeping the expected number of unaware participants high.",
